## Evaluation Process

### Phase 1: Self-Assessment (Pre-submission)
Students complete a self-assessment using the same rubric to identify strengths and areas for improvement.

### Phase 2: Peer Review
Students review each other's projects using a structured peer review process focusing on technical merit and innovation.

### Phase 3: Instructor Evaluation
Instructors evaluate projects using the detailed rubric, with emphasis on system functionality and integration quality.

### Phase 4: Final Assessment
A comprehensive final assessment combining all evaluation components to determine the final grade.

## Bonus Points (Up to 10 points)

### Extra Credit Opportunities:
- **Advanced Features**: Implementation of additional advanced features (up to 5 points)
- **Exceptional Innovation**: Truly groundbreaking approaches or solutions (up to 3 points)
- **Open Source Contribution**: Contributing code back to open source projects (up to 2 points)

## Submission Requirements

### Required Deliverables:
1. **Source Code Repository**: Complete, well-documented source code
2. **Technical Report**: 10-15 page technical report detailing implementation
3. **Video Demonstration**: 5-10 minute video showing system capabilities
4. **Presentation Slides**: Professional presentation slides
5. **System Architecture Document**: Detailed system architecture documentation

### Submission Format:
