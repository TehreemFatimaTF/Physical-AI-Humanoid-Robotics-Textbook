# Autonomous Humanoid Robot Capstone Project

## Project Overview

The capstone project for this Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics curriculum challenges students to design and implement a complete autonomous humanoid robot system that integrates all the concepts learned throughout the four modules. This project serves as the culmination of your learning journey, demonstrating proficiency in ROS 2, digital twin simulation, NVIDIA Isaac, and Vision-Language-Action systems.

## Project Objectives

The primary objectives of this capstone project are to:

1. **Integrate All Modules**: Combine ROS 2 communication, digital twin simulation, NVIDIA Isaac perception, and VLA systems into a unified humanoid robot platform
2. **Implement Cognitive Capabilities**: Create a robot that can understand natural language commands and execute complex tasks
3. **Demonstrate Physical AI**: Show how artificial intelligence can be embodied in physical robotic systems
4. **Validate in Simulation and Real-World**: Test the system in both simulated and real-world environments

## Project Requirements

### Hardware Requirements
- Humanoid robot platform (simulated or physical)
- RGB-D camera for perception
- Microphone array for voice commands
- NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano or equivalent for edge computing
- Sensors (IMU, encoders, force/torque sensors)

### Software Requirements
- ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill
- NVIDIA Isaac ROS
- Gazebo simulation environment
- OpenAI Whisper for speech recognition
- Large Language Model for cognitive planning

### Functional Requirements
1. **Perception System**: Detect and recognize objects in the environment
2. **Cognitive System**: Understand natural language commands and plan actions
3. **Action Execution**: Execute planned actions through robot controllers
4. **Human-Robot Interaction**: Provide feedback and status updates to users
5. **Safety Mechanisms**: Implement safety checks and emergency stops

## Project Phases

The capstone project is divided into four main phases:

1. **System Architecture Design**: Design the overall system architecture and component interactions
2. **Component Integration**: Integrate individual components (ROS 2, perception, planning, action)
3. **System Testing**: Test the integrated system in simulation and real-world
4. **Project Presentation**: Present the final system and demonstrate its capabilities

## Evaluation Criteria

Students will be evaluated based on:
- System functionality and reliability
- Integration quality across all modules
- Innovation in approach and implementation
- Documentation and presentation quality
- Performance in real-world testing

## Getting Started

This capstone project represents the ultimate challenge in Physical AI and humanoid robotics. By successfully completing this project, you will have demonstrated mastery of all the concepts covered in this curriculum and be well-prepared to tackle real-world robotics challenges.

Let's begin by designing the system architecture that will tie together all the components you've learned about in the previous modules.
