# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the comprehensive guide on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics! This textbook focuses on the convergence of artificial intelligence and physical systems, bridging the gap between digital intelligence and the physical world.

## Focus and Theme: AI Systems in the Physical World

The future of AI extends beyond digital spaces into the physical world. This capstone quarter introduces **Physical AI**—AI systems that function in reality and comprehend physical laws. Students learn to design, simulate, and deploy humanoid robots capable of natural human interactions using ROS 2, Gazebo, and NVIDIA Isaac.

## Course Overview

This course is structured into four comprehensive modules that progressively build your understanding of Physical AI:

- **Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)** - Learn about middleware for robot control, including ROS 2 Nodes, Topics, and Services
- **Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)** - Master physics simulation and environment building
- **Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)** - Explore advanced perception and training with Isaac Sim and Isaac ROS
- **Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)** - Understand the convergence of LLMs and Robotics

## Why Physical AI Matters

Humanoid robots represent the pinnacle of embodied intelligence, where AI systems must understand and interact with the physical world. This course prepares you to develop robots that can navigate, perceive, and manipulate objects in real-world environments.

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, you will be able to:
- Design and implement robotic systems using ROS 2
- Create digital twins for simulation and testing
- Develop AI-powered perception and navigation systems
- Integrate vision, language, and action for complex robotic tasks
- Implement autonomous humanoid robots for real-world applications
